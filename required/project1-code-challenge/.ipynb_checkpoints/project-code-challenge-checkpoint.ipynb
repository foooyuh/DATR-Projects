    "We will traverse along the string and pair the characters up with their associated count. The character pairs identified will not combine the counts for the same characters i.e. for a string 'aabaaa', the character pairs will be `[['a', 2], ['b', 1], ['a', 3]]` and not `[['a', 5], ['b', 1]]`. The character pairs are identified as such:\n",
    "1. Each current character being traversed is labelled as `curr_char`.\n",
    "1. For the character in the first position (`pos == 0`), we will initiate the count (`char_count`) of it to 1, and assign the `curr_char` to the variable `prev_char` which will indicate what the previous character is before we move on to the next character.\n",
    "1. For the rest of the characters, we will split them up into 2 categories:\n",
    "    1. The current character is different from the previous character - If this is the case, we will add the character (`prev_char`) and its associated count (`char_count`) to a list (`char_pairs`). Then, we will re-initiate the `prev_char` and `char_count` variable for the new character.\n",
    "    1. The current character is same as the previous character - If this is the case, we will increase (+1) the count (`char_count`) which is associated to both the current and previous character since they are the same.\n",
    "1. In all cases, if we are at the last character (`pos == len(string)-1`), we will add the character (`prev_char`) and its associated count (`char_count`) to a list (`char_pairs`).\n",

    "Since we only have to compress strings that have a same character appearing more than once consecutively, we will include a flag (`to_compress`) that tells us whether this occurs. By default, `to_compress` is `False`, but as long as the condition where the current character is the same as the previous character (the `else` condition) is satisfied, `to_compress` will be changed to `True`.\n",
